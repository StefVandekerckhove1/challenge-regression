# Regression

- Repository: `challenge-regression`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `6 days`
- Deadline: `09/12/2024 16:00`
- Team challenge : Solo

## Learning objectives

- Be able to apply a linear regression or a regression model in a real context.
- Be able to preprocess data for machine learning.

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" asks you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales.

Take the dataset that was previously **scraped**, **preprocessed** and **analyzed**.
Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.

- You have to handle NANs.
- You have to handle categorical data.
- You have to select features.
- You have to remove features that have too strong correlation.

### Must-have features

#### Step 1 : Data cleaning

You have collected your data, you have cleaned and analyzed it a first time!
So it's time to do some machine learning with it!

But first, we have to prepare the data for machine learning.

- No duplicates.
- No NANs.
- No text data.
- No features that have too strong correlation between them.

#### Step 2: Features engineering

Select the best features in order to train your model. Don't forget you can add value and menaing by creating new features from your dataset. Use Open Data and other resources.


#### Step 3: Data formatting

Now that the dataset is ready, you have to format it for machine learning:

- Divide your dataset for training and testing. (`X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`)

#### Step 4: Model selection

The dataset is ready. Now let's select a model, keep it to the model family you've been assigned.

#### Step 5: Apply your model

Apply your model on your data.

#### Step 6: Model evaluation

Let's evaluate your model. Which accuracy did you reach?
Try to answer those questions:

- How could you improve this result?
- Which part of the process has the most impact on the results?
- How should you divide your time working on this kind of project?
- Try to illustrate your model if it's possible to make it interpretable.

## Constraints

### Code style

- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring**
- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented** when necessary.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.
- Clean the git repository and delete useless branches
- PLEASE use OOP in your code, no more raw script create classes and functions please.

## Deliverables

1. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)

### Steps

1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
