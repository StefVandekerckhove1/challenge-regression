# Evaluation report

## code snippet of best and last model:





For the evaluation report I would like you to upload a detailed eval_metrics.md document of your best and last model with:
a code snippet of the model instantiation (to see which model it is, what parameters,...)
MAE (on training/test)
RMSE (on training/test)
R2 (on training/test)
MAPE (on training/test)
sMAPE (on training/test)
The list of features you've used and how you got it (to quickly understand if you've done data leakage)
Accuracy computing procedure (on a test set? What split %, 80/20, 90/10, 50/50? k-fold cross?)
Efficiency (training and inference time). The fastest the best (sustainability).
a quick presentation of the final dataset (how many records, did you merge some datasets together? did you scrape again? what cleaning step you've done, scaling, encoding, cross-validation.. No need of visuals, just bullet points)
