## Accuracy computing procedure:

The data is split into 20% test set and 80% training with a 5-fold cross validation.

## Model efficiency: 

- training time = 0.6s
- inference time = 1.5s

## Final dataset:

- The dataset contained originally 24397 records.
- Outliers were removed with 3-sigma rule.
- Entries of which municipalitites contained less then 20 properties were removed.
- Finally 5990 records remained.
